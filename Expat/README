This module is built on top of the expat C library written by
James Clark <jjc@jclark.com>. The complete expat distribution is contained
in the expat sub-directory. You may find out the version by reading
expat/expat.html.

If the file expat.patches in this sub-directory is non-empty, then I
have made local patches to this library. If there are patches, then
for each file that has been patched, there will be a corresponding file
with the same name but with an extra ".orig" suffix, that is the original
file.

The expat.patches file will contain the differences from the original to
my patched version. Using the patch facility, you could get to my patched
version from James Clark's original by applying expat.patches to the original.

If you are going to use this library outside of XML::Parser, then you
should stick with the original. To do this, just move each .orig file
to it's basename.
