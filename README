This is the XML::Parser module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

Installation.  It's best to install the files in ':blib:lib' into your 
'site_perl' folder; that, after all, is what it is meant for -

    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser.pm
    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser:Expat.pm
    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser:Encodings:*.enc
    {MACPERL}site_perl:MacCFM68K:auto:XML:Parser:Expat:Expat
    {MACPERL}site_perl:MacPPC:auto:XML:Parser:Expat:Expat

Also read the original README file for this distribution, included below.

For technical notes, please see 'README.Mac'.  Files which are referenced 
in that document as having been affected by this port are in folder 
'Original_t'.  This includes _original_ 't' test files.  These files are 
only for reference.

Testing.  The 't' files have been tested using both the MacPerl application 
and the MPW perl tool.  When testing before installation, use the -I switch 
(perl tool in MPW) or Edit>Preferences (MacPerl app) to add ':blib:lib' to 
your path, and make sure it precedes all others.

Examples.  Bear in mind that returned XML, by specification, is studded 
with linefeeds (character \012 octal or \xA hex).  For this reason, of the 
three example scripts in folder 'samples', I recommend using 'xmlcomments' 
with a grain of salt, and 'xmlfilter' maybe not at all.  :-) 'xmlstats' 
works just fine.

Here's an MPW command line to test 'xmlstats' before installing the files:

perl -I ':blib:lib' :samples:xmlstats :samples:REC-xml-19980210.xml

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The expat distribution is included in full in
this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

This is a beta version and there's resistance to making radical API
changes at this time, but minor, evolutionary changes may occur as I get
feedback from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install
