			XML::Parser Version 2.25

Copyright (c) 1998 Larry Wall and Clark Cooper.
All rights reserved.

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The perldoc program, provided with the perl distribution,
can be used to view this documentation. The expat distribution is included in
full in this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Differences from Version 2.24
=============================

Fixed a memory bug in Expat.xs that was causing a SEGV on the cdata.t
test (among other things).

There are now two default external entity handlers: file_ext_ent_handler
and lwp_ext_ent_handler. The first handles just files (and file URIs). It's
the same old handler that's been there for many versions of this package.
The second handler will deal with general URIs.

If the LWP package is installed, then lwp_ext_ent_handler is registered to
handle external entity references, otherwise file_ext_ent_handler is
registered.

Both of these handlers will choke on huge external entities, since they
read the entire entity before passing it on to the parser.

You still have the option of setting your own handler.
