			XML::Parser Version 2.27

Copyright (c) 1998 Larry Wall and Clark Cooper.
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The perldoc program, provided with the perl distribution,
can be used to view this documentation. The expat distribution is included in
full in this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Discussion on features and bugs of this software and general discussion
on topics relating to perl and XML takes place on the perl-xml mailing
list, to which you can subscribe by sending mail to:

Differences from Version 2.26
=============================

- Got rid of the shadow buffer, thus fixing some bugs and allowing ExpatNB
  to now use original_string and position_in_context.

- Added the skip_until method to XML::Parser::Expat class. This suspends
  handlers until the given element index is reached. Parsing proceeds
  very rapidly when handlers are suspended.

- A new utility, canonical, was added to the samples directory. It
  transforms an XML document read from the standard input into canonical
  XML on the standard output.

- Work around bug in perl 5.004 that has been causing "modification of a
  read-only value" bug since version 2.24 of XML::Parser.

- *** A backward incompatible change to Expat method xml_escape. ***
  The '>' character is no longer transformed by default. To get the
  same behavior, use $xp->xml_escape($string, '>', ...)

- Now using Version 19990728 of expat, with patches necessary to eliminate
  use of shadow buffer.

- Fixed a bug where the Doctype handler was bypassed when the ParseParamEnt
  option was set.

- Fixed a URI::URL require bug in Parser.pm.

- Eliminated "use English" and "$&" from XML::Parser::Expat.

- Replace use of "Perl_sv_setsv" in Expat.xs with "sv_setsv".

- Set the XML_NS and XML_BYTE_ORDER macros in Makefile.PL.
