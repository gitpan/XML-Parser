***

Patch to XML-Parser-2.26: Expat.xs is patched (the patch is found in the Extra
folder) to fix a problem with the setHandlers() method under perl 5.004, which
includes MacPerl.

***

This is a PPC/CFM68K shared library for MacOS. Please refer to the original
README (below) for an explanation of changes from previous versions. Be advised
that both the 2.24 and 2.25 versions of XML-Parser were broken.

Installation: unpack this distribution using Chris Nandor's 'untargzipme'
utility, and then drop the folder on the 'installme' droplet.

Alternatively, if you use Stuffit Expander, you will have to unbin the shared
library as a separate step (located in folders
:blib:lib:MacPPC:auto:XML:Parser:Expat and :blib:lib:MacCFM68K:auto:XML:Parser:Expat).

If manually installing, copy the entire folder :blib:lib:XML into your 'site_perl'
folder, and place the required shared library into folder
:site_perl:MacPPC:auto:XML:Parser:Expat or :site_perl:MacCFM68K:auto:XML:Parser:Expat.

Some of the tests in the t folder were slightly modified to work properly for
MacOS. The UNIX originals are identified with the suffix .orig.

			XML::Parser Version 2.26

Copyright (c) 1998 Larry Wall and Clark Cooper.
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The perldoc program, provided with the perl distribution,
can be used to view this documentation. The expat distribution is included in
full in this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install

Differences from Version 2.25
=============================

Fixed a bug in the DTD parser that prevented the external DTD from generating
calls to declaration handlers when there was no internal subset.

Fixed another bug in the DTD parser where it was mistakenly assuming that
entity values and attribute default values were coming to the default handler
with a single call.
