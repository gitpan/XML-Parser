This is the XML::Parser module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

Decompress macblib.sit.hqx and install the files in "macblib:lib".
Installing into your site_perl directory is best, as opposed to mucking up 
{MACPERL}lib -

    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser.pm
    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser:Expat.pm
    {MACPERL}site_perl:XML:Parser:Encodings:*.enc
    {MACPERL}site_perl:MacCFM68K:auto:XML:Parser:Expat:Expat
    {MACPERL}site_perl:MacPPC:auto:XML:Parser:Expat:Expat

Also read the original README file for this distribution, included below.

For technical notes, please see 'README.Mac'. Files which are referenced in 
that document as having been affected by this port are in folder 
'Mac_Changes'. This includes _modified_ Perl source and _unmodified_ 't' 
test files. These files are only for reference.

Many thanks to Chris Nandor, for efforts above and beyond, in helping me 
prepare a MacCPAN standard distribution.

			XML::Parser Version 2.19

Copyright (c) 1998 Larry Wall and Clark Cooper.
All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself. 

This is a Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser, expat.
It requires at least version 5.004 of perl. The documentation for this
extension can be found in pod format at the end of the files Parser.pm
and Expat/Expat.pm. The expat distribution is included in full in
this distribution in the directory Expat/expat.

This was modified from the original XML::Parser created by Larry Wall.

This is a beta version and there's resistance to making radical API
changes at this time, but minor, evolutionary changes may occur as I get
feedback from the people on the perl-xml mailing list. [You can subscribe to
this list by sending a message to subscribe-perl-xml@lyris.activestate.com.]

To configure this module, cd to the directory that contains this README file
and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL

Alternatively, if you plan to install XML::Parser somewhere other than
your system's perl library directory. You can type something like this:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl INSTALLDIRS=perl

Then to build you run make.

	make

You can then test the module by typing:

	make test

There are some sample utilities in the samples directory along with an
xml form of the XML specification to test them on. You may need to change
the '#!' line at the top of these utilities to what is appropriate for
your system. If you're going to play around with them prior to installing
the module, you would need to add the blib paths to your perl search
path, like this (assuming your current directory is samples):

    perl -I../blib/lib -I../blib/arch xmlcomments REC-xml-19980210.xml

or set your PERLLIB environment variable.

If you have write access to the installation directories, you may then
install by typing:

	make install
